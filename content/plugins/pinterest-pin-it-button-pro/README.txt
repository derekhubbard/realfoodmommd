* Added option to disable data-pin attributes from getting added to image tags.

= 3.1.0 =

* Image hover now allows you to right-click and save images by default (no overlay).
* Old image hover functionality with overlay and right-click image protection is now an option.
* When "any image" button type is enabled, pinning of thumbnails should instead use the full-size linked image if found. This feature should also work inside regular, Jetpack and NextGen galleries. This is done by injecting the data-pin-media attribute for each image.
* When "any image" button type is enabled, pinning of images from home, category, and other post listing pages should link to their original post URLs. This is done by injecting the data-pin-url attribute for each image.
* Image hover now works with two major lazy loading plugins: Lazy Load (http://wordpress.org/plugins/lazy-load/) and BJ Lazy Load (http://wordpress.org/plugins/bj-lazy-load/), and probably other lazy loading functionality using jQuery.sonar.

**Count bubble update**

We've improved how the count bubble behaves on listing pages. When "user selects image" is selected along with a custom "Pin It" button image, on post listing pages (home, categories, archives, etc), pins now point to the original post URL the button resides on, not the current page the pinner is viewing.

**Below image button (New)**

* Added option to show a "Pin It" button under each image.
* Allow stock "Pin It" button or use of custom button image (included in plugin or uploaded by user).
* Allow custom button height and width.
* Allow minimum image height and width to display "Pin It" buttons under.
* Can specify CSS classes that will prevent adding a "Pin It" button below an image.

**Image hover button**

* Fixed so now pins the URL the image originates from, not the URL the reader is on. Useful when reader is on a page that displays multiple posts, such as the home page.
* Added new option to always show image hover buttons (even when not hovering).
* Fixed issue that caused NextGen gallery thumbnails not to work.

**Social share bar**

* Added drag and drop interface for easier button arrangement.
* Better responsive styling -- social buttons now stack appropriately when viewing site on smaller devices.
* Improved performance of how third-party JavaScript was loading.
* Added Tweet hashtag (#) option.
* Added Google+ Share button.
